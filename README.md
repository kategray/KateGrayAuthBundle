Please note: This bundle is under heavy development and is not in a usable
state at this point in time.

This bundle provides support for applications written in Symfony (2.7-3.1) to
function as an Identity Provider (IDP) or as a Single-Sign-On (SSO) provider.

The initial (1.0) release of this library will support the CAS 1.0, 2.0, and 
3.0 protocols as described in the official specification, which can be found at
